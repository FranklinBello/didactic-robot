# Cygnus

## Description

Is a platform for students and tutors to communicate.

## Installation

Since Cygnus was developed using Flask, you will need to have some dependencies. 

1. Clone the project into your file system.
2. In the folder containing the project, use the following command to create an environment called ```env```:
    ```
    # macOs
    py -m venv env

    # Windows
    python -m venv env
    ```
3. Activate the environment by running:
    ```
    # bash
    source env/scripts/activate

    # cmd
    env\scripts\activate
    ```
4. Install the required packages by running:
    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
